Global warming refers to the long-term increase in Earth's average surface temperature due to human activities, particularly the emission of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane. These emissions, largely from burning fossil fuels and deforestation, trap heat in the atmosphere, leading to a range of environmental impacts. These include more frequent and severe weather events, rising sea levels, and disruptions to ecosystems and biodiversity. The consequences of global warming affect human health, agriculture, water resources, and infrastructure. Addressing global warming requires urgent international cooperation to reduce emissions, transition to renewable energy sources, and implement policies aimed at mitigating its effects and adapting to the changes it brings.
