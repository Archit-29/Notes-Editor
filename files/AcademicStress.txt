Academic stress refers to the psychological and emotional pressure experienced by students due to academic demands, such as exams, assignments, and expectations for performance. It can lead to anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, and difficulty concentrating. Factors contributing to academic stress include high workload, competition, fear of failure, and perfectionism. Students may also feel pressure from parents, teachers, or societal expectations. Effective coping strategies include time management, seeking support from peers and mentors, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, and practicing relaxation techniques. Addressing academic stress requires a balanced approach that promotes mental well-being alongside academic achievement, fostering resilience and sustainable learning habits among students.
