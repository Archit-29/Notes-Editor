Terrorism is the use of violence and intimidation, particularly against civilians, to achieve political, religious, or ideological goals. It involves various tactics, such as bombings, shootings, and cyber-attacks, carried out by individuals or groups. The impacts of terrorism are profound, leading to loss of life, psychological trauma, economic disruption, and heightened security measures. It also fosters fear and division within societies. Combating terrorism requires comprehensive strategies, including intelligence gathering, international cooperation, addressing root causes like poverty and political instability, and promoting counter-radicalization efforts to prevent the spread of extremist ideologies.
